This .md fiel is a summary of Power switch fundamentals of IGBT and SiC<br />
<br />
Difference between MOSFet, SiC MOSFET and IGBT<br />
<br />
  MOSFET and IGBT are based on Silicon material, SiC MOSFET based on SiC material.<br />
  Si MOSFET:<br />
    -operate in high frequency application<br />
    -low conduction loss(but not suitable for high current applications)<br />
  SiC MOSFET:<br />
    -higher bandgap energy and critical field breakdown voltage which is suitable for High-voltage operation<br />
    -higher thermal conductivity which requires less heatsinks<br />
    -lower switching loss<br />
  IGBT:<br />
    -Has internal
