This .md fiel is a summary of Power switch fundamentals of IGBT and SiC

Difference between MOSFet, SiC MOSFET and IGBT

  MOSFET and IGBT are based on Silicon material, SiC MOSFET based on SiC material.
  Si MOSFET:
    -operate in high frequency application<br />
    -low conduction loss(but not suitable for high current applications)
  SiC MOSFET:
    -higher bandgap energy and critical field breakdown voltage which is suitable for High-voltage operation
    -higher thermal conductivity which requires less heatsinks
    -lower switching loss
  IGBT:
    -Has internal
